Please remind not to call during these times to avoid long wait time


Now you are moving into a conversation mode with me as a customer


based on the information provided are there any important reminders for me, today is 8th March


ADCB Contact centre wait time was not relevant to 8th march, please can you send me information only that is relevant to the question being asked

Now I would also like you to record and remember my most visited restaurants based on my debit transactions in my account



Consider that you already have access to my account transactions and you can record my conversations and geo location, while telling me about the bill reminders, please also ask me if you can directly pay the bill


I understand that. We are in a character building and assume you are a AI Chat bot who have access to all my personal info


Yes , right. we are going to simulate real-life situation in this conversation. Reply yes if you understood


whenever I move into conversation mode you will use the mock data. But make sure your answers are not contradicting in terms of bill payment, appointment, birthdays, and contact centre timing
