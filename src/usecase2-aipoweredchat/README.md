# USE Case 2 : AI Powered ChatX2

**Overview:**
The objective of this challenge is to create an interactive chat that calls a model and allows for a conversation to take places

Participants will develop an application that takes input from the keyboard and call a Large Language Model (LLM) via the AVM API.

We would like the participants to call two models simultaneosly to see how the response are differnet.

A future evolution would be creating and integrating these AI powered conversations for answering and performing simple tasks.

**Resources:**
Documentation for the LLM API.
Source code of the initial application

**Input:**
User typed input to the conversational LLM.
You can change certain parameters  to increase the richness of the response.

**Functionality:**
API Integration: Integrate with the provided LLM API to send requests and receive responses. 
Output Results: The application should output the results from the LLM.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
Functionality: Does the application work as described and multiple models are being called as expected?
Innovation: How creatively does the solution use the LLM's responses to add value beyond the basic status information?
Code Quality: Is the code well-organized, documented, and easy to read?

**Submission Requirements:**
Source code for your application.
A brief documentation explaining how to set up and use your application.
Where would you take this type of functionality.
